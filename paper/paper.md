### Introduction

The Morphing Infinity Spiral (MIS) is a mathematical construct that combines scaling, rotation, and time-dependent transformations to produce evolving patterns with partial self-similarity and fractal-like properties. Unlike static fractals, the MIS disrupts scale invariance over time, providing a unique framework for exploring dynamic symmetry-breaking phenomena and the interplay between time and structure in complex systems.

This work stems from fundamental questions about the nature of scaling, nonlinearity, and time evolution in mathematical and physical systems. By combining complex scaling, logarithmic transformations, and time-dependent rotations, the MIS reveals intricate behaviors that challenge traditional assumptions about entropy, information flow, and system noise. Specifically, this study examines:
1. **The role of entropy** in enhancing rather than degrading system utility.
2. **The constructive potential of noise** in fostering resilience and adaptability in dynamic systems.
3. **The emergent patterns of information flow** in systems that deviate from strict control.

The MIS equation, constructed from these principles, generates dynamic spirals whose behavior is dictated by the parameters of scale, rotation, and time. This work examines the mathematical properties of the MIS, including scale invariance, rotational symmetry, and the breakdown of these symmetries over time. Computational experiments are used to study the emergent behaviors of the system, such as fractal dimension, dynamic symmetry evolution, and the sensitivity of patterns to parameter variations.

By providing a structured analysis of the MIS, this study aims to contribute to the understanding of dynamic systems with evolving symmetry properties. The results have potential implications for modeling complex phenomena across mathematics, physics, and information theory, where systems are shaped by nonlinearity, entropy, and time-dependent behaviors.

There are several qualities of the MIS and its PDE that are relevant for fields such as signal processing, quantum computing and encryption. The operations allowed by the MIS transformations are chaotic enough to create high levels of randomness, these are not fully unbounded chaotic systems, as they can scale with scale invariance, which in a fractal context, suggests self-observance. As we explore these mathematical objects, the optimal radius of these structures will reveal attractors. The intricate balance of the equation is useful for approximating mathematical singularities. 

This dissertation will also be able to explore the emergent properties of high-entropy in a framework that usually has not been seen. With self-observance and self-similarity, the entropy in this systems form vortex clusters that organize the chaotic behaviour.



With help of Machine Learning we are able to approximate the optimal radius of these fractals, which reveals singularity approximation and attractors.

The image show the optimal radius of the MIS that reveals a machine like sctructure. The structure is often refeared as attractor or dynamic attractor in this case. 

![optimal_radius](images/optimal_radius_attractors.png)

 The approximations done with learnable parameters allow us to find the optimal radius in other algorithms, like the Ikeda Map for example:

![ikeda_map](images/Ikeda_map_attractor.jpeg)

 While not ideal, this suggest exploration into attractors is possible with this kind of ML algorithms. Number approximations and optimal paths might be a good way to `a)` *cut on energy waste* `b)` *cheaping production.* While there is a certain number of things we will try using the MIS, including large scale quantum kernels allowed by the use of complex tensors.

**Key Observations**

<small>

**Phase Map Insights:**

The attractor exhibits a spiral-like central structure that evolves into symmetric rings as you move outward.
The colors represent phase (argument) of the complex values, demonstrating smooth transitions and cyclic patterns.
At the center, the structure shows complex interweaving, indicating potential singularity or chaotic dynamics.

Fractal Dimension:

The fractal dimension was calculated as 2.0000, suggesting a plane-filling attractor. This is consistent with the intricate, 2D structures visible in the phase map.

Simulation Dynamics:

The simulation encountered divergence at step 7 (max |Z| = 1.3476e+10). Despite early termination, it managed to compute meaningful outputs, including the fractal dimension and the final phase map.

</small>

This paper also has the intention to introduce some of the problems that seem unexplained. The simulations show intricate 2D structures that are visible in the phase map. It is believed that there are not much scientific baking to their existence. **(come back to this in detail)**

We will also introduce the MISTransform that can be used for Machine Learning and random number generation, between other things.

To build the **Morphing Infinity Spiral (MIS)** from scratch, we need to understand its components, step by step, by breaking the equation into fundamental mathematical and geometric concepts.

![mis_3blue_style](images/mis_3blue_style.png)

---



### **Starting Point**
At its heart, the **MIS** combines ideas from:
1. **Scaling**: Transforming a shape by stretching or compressing it.
2. **Complex Exponentiation**: Representing scaling and rotation using complex numbers.
3. **Logarithmic Growth**: Controlling how transformations scale nonlinearly.
4. **Time Evolution**: Adding dynamics to the system, making it morph.

>Right Plot (Logarithmic Transform): This shows what happens when we take log ⁡ ( z ) log(z) The curved spiral becomes a straight line The exponential growth becomes linear The rotation becomes a linear phase change

---

### **Base Concept - Complex Scaling**
We start with a simple power-law function:
\[
f(z) = z^\alpha, \quad z \in \mathbb{C}, \, \alpha \in \mathbb{C}.
\]
This function:
- **Scales** \(z\) by \(|z|^\text{Re}(\alpha)\), stretching or compressing the magnitude.
- **Rotates** \(z\) by \(\text{Im}(\alpha) \cdot \arg(z)\), where \(\arg(z)\) is the angle of \(z\) in polar form.

#### Key Property:
For any scale factor \(k > 0\),
\[
f(kz) = k^\alpha \cdot f(z).
\]
This is **scale invariance**: the shape remains similar after scaling.

![complex_scaling](images/complex_scaling.png)


---

### **Adding Complexity - Logarithms in the Complex Plane**
To introduce nonlinearity, we use the **complex logarithm**:
\[
\log(z) = \ln|z| + i\arg(z).
\]
The logarithm:
1. Separates the **magnitude** (\(\ln|z|\)) and **phase** (\(\arg(z)\)) of \(z\).
2. Grows nonlinearly, introducing interesting behaviors for large or small \(|z|\).


![logarithms_complex_plane](images/logarithms_complex_plane.png)

---

### **Morphing with Time - Exponentiation with Time Parameter**
We make the function dynamic by adding a **time-dependent rotation**:
\[
g(z, t) = \exp(i \cdot t \cdot (\log(z))^\beta), \quad \beta \in \mathbb{C}.
\]
This term creates:
- **Rotation** controlled by \(t\), with \((\log(z))^\beta\) determining how rotation changes with \(|z|\) and \(\arg(z)\).
- **Time Evolution**: As \(t\) changes, the spiral pattern morphs.


![time_depedent_morphing](images/time_dependent_morphing.png)

---

### **Combining Scaling and Morphing**
Finally, we combine the scaling and morphing terms:
\[
S_{\alpha, \beta}(z, t) = z^\alpha \cdot \exp(i \cdot t \cdot (\log(z))^\beta).
\]
This equation balances:
1. **Scale Invariance** (\(z^\alpha\)): Preserves structure when \(t = 0\).
2. **Time Evolution** (\(\exp(i \cdot t \cdot (\log(z))^\beta)\)): Introduces dynamic morphing.

![scaling_morphing](images/scaling_morphing.png)
---

### ** Emergent Behavior**
The MIS exhibits several fascinating properties:
1. **Fractals and Self-Similarity**: Repeated application of \(S_{\alpha, \beta}\) creates patterns with partial self-similarity.
2. **Scale-Time Interplay**: As \(t\) increases, the perfect scale invariance of \(z^\alpha\) is disrupted by the time-dependent rotation.
3. **Complex Dynamics**: The interaction of \(\alpha\), \(\beta\), and \(t\) creates intricate spirals and patterns.

![emergent_property](images/emergent_behavior.png)

---

### Building Intuition with an Example
Let’s compute \(S_{\alpha, \beta}(z, t)\) for specific values:
- \(z = 1 + i\): A complex number in the first quadrant.
- \(\alpha = 0.5 + 0.5i\): Balances scaling and rotation.
- \(\beta = 1\): Linear effect of \(\log(z)\).
- \(t = 0\): No time evolution.

At \(t = 0\):
\[
S_{\alpha, \beta}(z, 0) = z^\alpha.
\]

For \(t > 0\):
\[
S_{\alpha, \beta}(z, t) = z^\alpha \cdot \exp(i \cdot t \cdot \log(z)).
\]
The time evolution introduces rotation at a rate proportional to \(\log(z)\).

![example](images/intuition_example.png)


# Complex Scaling
The first component of the MIS is scaling a complex number 𝑧 by a complex exponent 𝛼. This operation combines magnitude scaling and phase rotation.


**sample:**

`Complex scaling result for z=(1+1j), alpha=(0.5+0.5j): (0.6777725052404346+0.4306022701168375j)`



### **Understanding the Complex Scaling Result**

The result of the **complex scaling** operation for \( z = 1 + i \) and \( \alpha = 0.5 + 0.5i \) is:
\[
z^\alpha = 0.6778 + 0.4306i
\]

To explain this result mathematically, let’s break it down step by step:

![complex_scaling](images/complex_scaling_operation.png)
---

### **Mathematical Breakdown**

#### 1. Polar Representation of \(z\)
A complex number \( z = x + yi \) can be expressed in polar form as:
\[
z = r \cdot e^{i\theta}, \quad r = |z| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}, \, \theta = \arg(z) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)
\]

For \( z = 1 + i \):
\[
r = \sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{2}, \quad \theta = \tan^{-1}(1) = \frac{\pi}{4}
\]

![polar_representation_of_z](images/polar_representation_z.png)

#### 2. Applying the Complex Exponent
The operation \( z^\alpha \) involves:
\[
z^\alpha = (r \cdot e^{i\theta})^\alpha = r^{\text{Re}(\alpha)} \cdot e^{-\text{Im}(\alpha)\theta} \cdot e^{i(\text{Re}(\alpha)\theta + \text{Im}(\alpha)\ln(r))}
\]

Substitute \( r = \sqrt{2} \), \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), and \( \alpha = 0.5 + 0.5i \):
1. **Magnitude Scaling**:
   \[
   r^{\text{Re}(\alpha)} = (\sqrt{2})^{0.5} = 2^{0.25} \approx 1.1892
   \]
2. **Phase Modification**:
   - Phase rotation from real part:
     \[
     \text{Re}(\alpha) \cdot \theta = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\pi}{8}
     \]
   - Additional phase from imaginary part:
     \[
     \text{Im}(\alpha) \cdot \ln(r) = 0.5 \cdot \ln(\sqrt{2}) = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\ln(2)}{2} = \frac{\ln(2)}{4} \approx 0.1733
     \]

The total phase:
\[
\phi = \frac{\pi}{8} + i\frac{\ln(2)}{4} \approx 0.3927 + 0.1733
\]


![complex_exponent](images/complex_exponent.png)

#### 3. Combining Magnitude and Phase
The final scaled value is:
\[
z^\alpha = r^{\text{Re}(\alpha)} \cdot e^{i\phi}
\]
Numerically:
\[
z^\alpha = 1.1892 \cdot e^{i(0.3927 + 0.1733)} \approx 0.6778 + 0.4306i
\]

### **Graphical Representation**

We can visualize the effect of complex scaling by plotting the original \(z\) and the scaled \(z^\alpha\) on the complex plane.

This transformation is particularly interesting because both the base and the exponent are complex numbers, which makes it a rich mathematical operation with applications in various fields like signal processing and complex analysis.

### **Results from Visualization**
1. **Original Point**: The red point corresponds to the original complex number \( z = 1 + 1i \).
2. **Scaled Point**: The blue point represents the result of \( z^\alpha \), showing both magnitude scaling and rotation on the complex plane.

---

### **Insight**
- Complex scaling simultaneously **stretches** the magnitude and **rotates** the phase of \(z\).
- The operation preserves some geometric properties (e.g., smooth mapping of lines into curves), which is critical for fractal generation in the MIS.
- Observing these transformations helps understand how \(z^\alpha\) contributes to fractal properties and symmetry breaking in the full MIS.



# Adding the Logarithm

Next, we incorporate the logarithm of 𝑧, which introduces **nonlinearity** into the transformation.

Code Implementation:

```python
def complex_logarithm(z):
    """
    Compute the complex logarithm log(z).
    
    Parameters:
        z (complex or ndarray): Input complex number(s).
    
    Returns:
        complex or ndarray: Logarithm of z.
    """
    return np.log(z)

# Example
log_z = complex_logarithm(z)
print(f"Complex logarithm of z={z}: {log_z}")

```

**sample:**

`Complex logarithm of z=(1+1j): (0.34657359027997264+0.7853981633974483j)`


### **Understanding the Complex Logarithm Result**

The result of the complex logarithm for \( z = 1 + i \) is:
\[
\log(z) = 0.3466 + 0.7854i
\]

This value combines two key components:
1. The **magnitude** (\(\ln|z|\)): Represents the natural logarithm of the modulus of \(z\).
2. The **phase** (\(\arg(z)\)): Represents the angle of \(z\) in the complex plane.


![complex_logarithm_results](images/complex_logarithm_results.png)

---

### **Mathematical Breakdown**

#### 1. Polar Representation of \(z\)
The complex logarithm is defined as:
\[
\log(z) = \ln|z| + i \arg(z),
\]
where:
- \( |z| \) is the modulus: \( |z| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \)
- \( \arg(z) \) is the phase (angle): \( \arg(z) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{y}{x}\right) \)

For \( z = 1 + i \):
1. **Modulus**:
   \[
   |z| = \sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{2} \approx 1.4142
   \]
2. **Phase**:
   \[
   \arg(z) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{1}\right) = \frac{\pi}{4} \approx 0.7854
   \]

#### 2. Applying the Logarithm
1. The magnitude term is:
   \[
   \ln|z| = \ln(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{\ln(2)}{2} \approx 0.3466
   \]
2. Combine the terms:
   \[
   \log(z) = 0.3466 + 0.7854i
   \]

---

### **Graphical Representation**

The complex logarithm maps a point \(z\) in the complex plane to a new point whose:
1. **Real part** is based on the magnitude (\(\ln|z|\)).
2. **Imaginary part** is based on the angle (\(\arg(z)\)).

![visual](images/complex_logarithm_graph.png)


We can visualize this by plotting:
1. The original point \(z = 1 + i\) in the complex plane.
2. The logarithmic transformation \(\log(z)\) in a new space.

![plot_complex_logarithms](images/plot_complex_logarithm.png)

### **Results from Visualization**

#### Graph 1: Original Complex Number
- The red dot represents the complex number \(z = 1 + i\) in the complex plane.

#### Graph 2: Complex Logarithm
- The blue dot shows the logarithmic transformation \(\log(z)\), with:
  - The **real part** (\(0.3466\)) indicating the magnitude scaling (\(\ln|z|\)).
  - The **imaginary part** (\(0.7854\)) representing the phase (\(\arg(z)\)).

---

### **Insight**
- The complex logarithm separates \(z\) into **magnitude** and **phase**, effectively mapping it to a new coordinate system.
- This transformation is central to the **MIS** equation as it allows nonlinear scaling and rotation via \((\log(z))^\beta\).
- Observing this mapping visually helps understand how the logarithmic component contributes to the dynamic morphing in the full MIS.







---

### **Mathematical Foundations**
1. Define the basic elements of the MIS equation:
   - Complex numbers
   - Power-law scaling (\(z^\alpha\))
   - Logarithmic term (\(\log(z)\))
   - Time-dependent rotation via exponential (\(\exp(i \cdot t \cdot (\log(z))^\beta)\))


1. **Test for Scale Invariance**: Verify the MIS property \(S(kz, t) = k^\alpha S(z, t)\) for \(t=0\).
   - Write a test to compare \(S(kz, t)\) and \(k^\alpha S(z, t)\) numerically.

2. **Introduce Iteration**: Implement iterative applications of \(S_{\alpha,\beta}\) to study emergent properties like fractals.

3. **Visualize the Spiral**:
   - Generate 2D plots to visualize the MIS structure for \(t=0\) and \(t \neq 0\).
   - Vary \(\alpha\), \(\beta\), and \(t\) to observe transformations.

4. **Expand Tests**:
   - Rotational symmetry: \(S(e^{i\theta}z, t) = e^{i\alpha\theta} S(z, t)\)
   - Time evolution: Numerical versus analytical derivatives with respect to \(t\).


![mis_structure](images/mis_structure.png)


# **Time-Dependent Rotation**

We now introduce the time evolution term

\[
\exp\left(i \cdot t \cdot (\log(z))^\beta\right)
\]


SAMPLE:

`Time rotation result for z=(1+1j), t=1.0, beta=1.0: (0.4288290062943678+0.15487175246424675j)`

**Description:**
- Introduces dynamics by rotating \( z \) based on \( \log(z) \).
- Varies with time (\( t \)) and the complexity of \( \beta \).

**Research Goal:**
This term breaks scale invariance as \( t \) grows, allowing us to study time-dependent transformations.


![mis_transformation](images/mis_transform.png)



Combining the Components:

Finally, we combine the scaling and time evolution to construct the full MIS transformation.


![full_mis](images/mis_transformation_full.png)


`MIS result for z=(1+1j), alpha=(0.5+0.5j), beta=1.0, t=1.0: (0.22396038172782223+0.28962255926097136j)`
